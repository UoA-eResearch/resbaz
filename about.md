##### What is ResBaz?

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a worldwide festival promoting digital literacy at the centre of modern research. Every year, ResBaz events are held across the globe. The aim of these events is to equip the research community with the digital skills and tools required to do their research better, faster and smarter. Traditionally an in-person event blending academic and social life, ResBaz is an event unlike any academic conference. 

##### What is ResBaz Aotearoa?

Research Bazaar Aotearoa is free and open to everyone within the Aotearoa research community. We take an inclusive approach, and define the research community as everyone who applies digital skills to research. This includes researchers, research students, research support, technicians, librarians, research communicators, volunpeers, archivists, citizen scientists, and more. Registrations are provided through EventBrite. You can find a booking link attached to each session description on the sessions page, or by clicking the session name on the schedule page. Some sessions have a limited capacity and this is displayed next to the duration and level of the session. Please only register for limited capacity sessions if you intend to attend the live event. If you need to cancel your registration before the event, please see [these instructions](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/support/articles/en_US/How_To/how-to-cancel-your-free-registration?lg=en_MY) from EventBrite.

All participants are invited to [join](https://uoacer.slack.com/archives/C02P2DYJXD4) the Centre for eResearch ResBaz 2023 Slack channel.

ResBaz Aotearoa is a collaboration between the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Otago and the [Beyond Prediction: Explanatory and Transparent Data Science Programme](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/ssif-funded-programmes/university-of-auckland/\). Instructors are based at a variety of Aotearoa research institutions and companies, and they volunteer to teach at ResBaz. We wouldn't be able to do it without them and we appreciate their willingness to share their knowledge. 

##### Want to get involved?

If you're interested in volunteering to deliver a workshop, help out with a workshop, or spread the word at your institution, please <a href = "mailto: researchdata@auckland.ac.nz">get in touch</a> and tell us how you'd like to contribute.

##### Are sessions recorded?

2-3 hour sessions will not be recorded in order to encourage participants to attend and to fully engage with instructors. Instructors presenting 1 hour taster sessions will decide whether or not their sessions will be recorded. You can see which sessions will be recorded on the [sessions page](https://resbaz.auckland.ac.nz/sessions/) (check back in the week before ResBaz to see the latest updates). Recordings will be made available to ResBaz registrants following the event.
