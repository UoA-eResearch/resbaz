##### What is ResBaz Aotearoa?

The Research Bazaar (ResBaz) is a global community promoting digital literacy at the centre of modern research. Every year, ResBaz events are held across the globe to equip the research community with practical digital skills to do their research better, faster, and smarter. ResBaz is an event unlike any academic conference. 

Research Bazaar Aotearoa is a free online digital research skills workshop series. It is open to everyone within the Aotearoa research community. We take an inclusive approach, and define the research community as everyone who applies digital skills to research. This includes researchers, research students, research support, technicians, librarians, research communicators, volunpeers, archivists, citizen scientists, and more. Registrations are provided through EventBrite. You can find a booking link attached to each session description on the sessions page, or by clicking the session name on the schedule page. Some sessions have a limited capacity and this is displayed next to the duration and level of the session. Please only register for limited capacity sessions if you intend to attend the live event. If you need to cancel your registration before the event, please see [these instructions](https://www.eventbrite.co.nz/help/en-nz/articles/557726/how-to-cancel-or-delete-a-free-order/) from EventBrite.

ResBaz Aotearoa is a collaboration between the University of Auckland, Victoria University of Wellington, University of Otago, Plant & Food Research, University of Waikato, and the [Beyond Prediction: Explanatory and Transparent Data Science Programme](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/ssif-funded-programmes). Instructors are based at a variety of Aotearoa research institutions and companies, and they volunteer to teach at ResBaz. We wouldn't be able to do it without them and we appreciate their willingness to share their knowledge. 

##### Want to get involved?

If you're interested in volunteering to deliver a workshop, help out with a workshop, or spread the word at your institution, please <a href = "mailto: researchdata@auckland.ac.nz">get in touch</a> and tell us how you'd like to contribute.

##### Are sessions recorded?

Sessions will not be recorded unless otherwise stated. In addition, AI assistants (e.g. Otter Pilot, Fireflies.AI) will be removed from rooms to maintain privacy.

##### Code of Conduct

ResBaz Aotearoa is intended for Aotearoa-affiliated members of the research community.
