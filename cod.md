__This "Don't be a jerk" policy is a shortened, more casual version of the longer Code of Conduct policy. [Read full version](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick).__


ResBaz prides itself on being an open, respectful, and inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at ResBaz. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop.

If someone is bothering you, please tell ResBaz Organizers immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain ResBaz's awesomeness.
