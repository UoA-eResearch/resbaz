##### Research Bazaar Policies and Code of Conduct
*Attending or contributing to ResBaz? Please read our policies (recording, reporting and anti-harassment) and Code of Conduct. We’re really serious about making sure that everyone feels safe and has a good time at all our events!*

##### Policies and Code of Conduct
Throughout these policies, we refers to the Research Bazaar team of staff and volunteers.

By attending or contributing to the Research Bazaar, **you agree to be bound by these policies and Code of Conduct.**

##### Code of Conduct
*This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from the ResBaz Melbourne [Code of Conduct](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/code-of-conduct/).*

The Research Bazaar is a learning environment where everyone is welcome. It’s a diverse community from a wide range of backgrounds and interests, academically and socially. To ensure that everyone has a safe and enjoyable experience, please bring a spirit of respect and friendly inquiry to all your interactions at the Research Bazaar.

**Be friendly and polite.**

**Be welcoming.** The Research Bazaar strives to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. People from all stages of their careers and fields of inquiry are welcome.

**Be respectful.** Participants come from a huge range of backgrounds and experience levels. Everyone should feel comfortable to ask for the help they need to understand the discussion. Listen and support others to learn. Remember that everyone here has their own field of expertise.

**Be kind to others.** Be careful and respectful in the words that you choose to use. Do not insult or put down other participants or their background.

**Online participation**

* Join online sessions promptly - assistance for those who join late is unlikely to be available. 
* Mute yourself at all times unless invited to contribute. Session hosts may invite questions from the audience verbally or through the ‘Chat’ function within Zoom. 
* Be patient with solo presenters/speakers - they are choosing to share their time, enthusiasm and knowledge. 
* Disruptive behaviour, intended or unintended, may result in the session hosts muting or removing you from the virtual session. 

**Video/audio recording policy**

We will be recording some of the ResBaz 2021 : Pick n Mix sessions using virtual meeting software (e.g. Zoom). These recordings may be shared online by the Research Bazaar team.

If you do not wish to be recorded, please consider the following measures: 

* keep your video turned off
* remain muted
* change your Zoom name.

If someone indicates that they do not wish to be recorded please consider how you interact with them so as not to identify them.

##### Reporting/blogging/social media policy
We encourage all ResBaz attendees to join the conversation on Twitter before, during and after the conference. We also encourage attendees to discuss their experiences by blogging or writing pieces for their home institution blogs and newsletters if appropriate. We will be covering the conference by live-tweeting and blogging. Attendees are reminded that the Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment policy extend to online interactions associated with the Research Bazaar.

Comments made on social media may be republished with attribution (for example retweeting or embedding of Tweets in blogs). If you wish to attribute an opinion or statement to an individual in a long-form piece, please verify with that individual that they feel you have written an accurate representation of their view, especially if it concerns their research.

Please remember that the Research Bazaar is a learning environment and **don’t distract other attendees by photographing/ live tweeting excessively during training sessions.**

##### Anti-harassment policy
*This policy is based on the ResBaz Melbourne [Code of Conduct](https://resbazblog.wordpress.com/code-of-conduct/).*

###### Summary
The Research Bazaar is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone at our events and in our forums. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Attendees violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event and its forums at the discretion of the anti-harassment officers or the host.

###### Detailed policy
Harassment includes:

* offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race or ethnicity, religion, or other personal attributes or identities
* unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices
* sexual images in public spaces
* deliberate intimidation
* stalking or following
* threats of violence or incitements to violence against an individual
* violating the recording policy
* sustained disruption of talks or other events
* sustained attacks on an attendee’s research topic or project

* Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviors are expected to comply immediately. Any member of the Research Bazaar staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behaviour violates the conference’s anti-harassment policy. A record of complaints received and warnings issued will be maintained to enable any repeat offenders to be identified.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviors, the anti-harassment officers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact <a href = "mailto: researchdata@auckland.ac.nz">researchdata@auckland.ac.nz</a> We will assist participants to contact police or crisis.
