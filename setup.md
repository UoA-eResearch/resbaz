Some sessions at ResBaz Aotearoa require participants to follow set up instructions before the event. If you have registered for a session requiring set up, you will be provided with a link to the relevant instructions on this page. If you have any trouble following these instructions then please join us at a [HackyHour](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/) session. We will be running sessions at 3pm on Tuesday in the week before ResBaz, and on Tuesday in the week of ResBaz.

##### <b>Authoring Collaborative Research Projects In Quarto</b>

This session is designed to be easy to follow but is targeted at people already familiar with basic coding, code editing software, and version control. We will be using R as an example but Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript are the primary languages Quarto supports. Experience with R is not required.
Before the session, install:
1. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
4. [Log in to GitHub (or sign up for a free account)](https://github.com/)
5. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
  - VS Code Extensions (install in the extensions tab in VS Code):
    - R
    - Quarto
    - Git

##### <b>Digital Storytelling with KnightLab</b>

If possible, bring along some information on your favourite movie such as name, date, a link to a related image (right click and choose "Save Image Link"), and one or two sentences on why you like it. We'll use this to collectively make a [TimeLine](http://timeline.knightlab.com/).  

##### <b>Getting Started with the Julia Programming Language</b>

Please follow the setup instructions [here](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl/blob/dev/INSTALLATION.md).

##### <b>Introduction to Cleaning & Transforming Data with OpenRefine</b>

Install OpenRefine:
- If using an unrestricted device, follow the instructions under 'OpenRefine' [here](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html#openrefine).
- If using a restricted device (e.g. University of Auckland), search for and install ‘Corretto OpenJDK’ in Software Center (Windows) or Self-Service (Mac). Then download OpenRefine 3.7.9 [here](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/releases/download/3.7.9/openrefine-win-3.7.9.zip) and extract the contents to your user folder (C:\users\abcd001). You should end up with a folder called 'openrefine-3.7.9' in your user folder.

##### <b>Introduction to the Command Line</b>

Please follow the instructions for your operating system found [here](https://murraycadzow.github.io/2024-07-09-nz-unix/#the-bash-shell).

##### <b>Managing References with Zotero</b>

If you'd like to follow along you will need to:
1. Go to (https://www.zotero.org/user/register) and create a zotero account.
2. Install Zotero:
   - On personal or unrestricted devices: Go to (https://www.zotero.org/download/) and install both Zotero (a standalone app) and the appropriate Zotero Connector (an extension for your browser). 
   - On restricted devices (e.g. University of Auckland) install Zotero through the Software Center (Windows) or Self Service (Mac).

Open Zotero and from the top menu bar select Edit > Preferences > Sync and fill in your zotero account details, then select OK. We recommend a two-screen setup for those wishing to follow along.

##### <b>How to Create a LaTeX Report Without Losing Hair</b>

We will run through some set up instructions in the workshop, but you'll need to have created an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account prior to the workshop, and have logged in to it.
