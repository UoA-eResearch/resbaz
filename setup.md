Some sessions at ResBaz Aotearoa require participants to follow set up instructions before the event. If you have registered for a session requiring set up, you will be provided with a link to the relevant instructions on this page. If you have any trouble following these instructions then please join us at a [HackyHour](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/) session. We will be running sessions at 3pm on Tuesday in the week before ResBaz, and on Tuesday in the week of ResBaz.

1. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
4. [Log in to GitHub (or sign up for a free account)](https://github.com/)
5. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
  - VS Code Extensions (install in the extensions tab in VS Code):
    - R
    - Quarto

This is a hands-on, follow-along workshop, and having a dual monitor set-up is highly recommended if possible.
To prepare for the workshop, before the session please:
1. Set up a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one)
2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Download a free text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
4. Have some assets you'd like to use for your site (e.g. a profile picture, bio, description of research projects and related images, a brief list of skills and experience, a collection of articles/publications – the raw text, e.g. word documents, will be helpful). Collate these into one folder.
 
Note: Some familiarity with git, HTML and CSS will be beneficial, but not necessary.
