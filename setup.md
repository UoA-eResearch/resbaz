Some sessions at ResBaz Aotearoa require participants to follow set up instructions before the event. If you have registered for a session requiring set up, you will be provided with a link to the relevant instructions on this page. If you have any trouble following these instructions then please join us at a [HackyHour](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/) session. We will be running sessions at 3pm on Tuesday in the week before ResBaz, and on Tuesday in the week of ResBaz.

This is a hands-on, follow-along workshop, having a dual monitor set-up is highly recommended if possible.
To prepare for the workshop, before the session please:
- Set up a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one)
- Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Download a free text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- Have some assets you'd like to use for your site (e.g. a profile picture, bio, description of research projects and related images, a brief list of skills and experience, a collection of articles/publications â€“ the raw text, e.g. word documents, will be helpful). Collate these into one folder.
 
Note: Some familiarity with git, HTML and CSS will be beneficial, but not necessary.
