Some sessions at ResBaz Aotearoa require participants to follow set up instructions before the event. If you have registered for a session requiring set up, you will be provided with a link to the relevant instructions on this page. If you have any trouble following these instructions then please join us at a [HackyHour](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/HackyHour/) session. We will be running sessions at 3pm on Tuesday in the week before ResBaz, and on Tuesday in the week of ResBaz.

##### <b>Authoring Collaborative Research Projects In Quarto</b>

This session is designed to be easy to follow but is targeted at people already familiar with basic coding, code editing software, and version control. We will be using R as an example but Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript are the primary languages Quarto supports. Experience with R is not required.
Before the session, install:
1. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
4. [Log in to GitHub (or sign up for a free account)](https://github.com/)
5. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or use Software Center/Self Service on University of Auckland devices.
  - VS Code Extensions (install in the extensions tab in VS Code):
    - R
    - Quarto
    - Git

##### <b>Build a Research Portfolio Website (Using GitHub)</b>

This is a hands-on, follow-along workshop, and having a dual monitor set-up is highly recommended if possible.
To prepare for the workshop, before the session please:
1. Set up a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you don't already have one)
2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Download a free text editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
4. Have some assets you'd like to use for your site (e.g. a profile picture, bio, description of research projects and related images, a brief list of skills and experience, a collection of articles/publications – the raw text, e.g. word documents, will be helpful). Collate these into one folder.

Note: Some familiarity with git, HTML and CSS will be beneficial, but not necessary.

##### <b>Digital Storytelling with KnightLab</b>

If possible, bring along some information on your favourite movie such as name, date, a link to a related image (right click and choose "Save Image Link"), and one or two sentences on why you like it. We'll use this to collectively make a [TimeLine](http://timeline.knightlab.com/).  

##### <b>Getting Started with the Julia Programming Language</b>

1. [Install Julia 1.9](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl/blob/dev/FIRST_STEPS.md). 
2. [Install workshop resources](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl/wiki/Preparing-for-your-ResBaz-2023-Julia-workshop). 

- Recommended: An understanding of basic linear algebra and statistics, such as that covered in first year university courses. 
- Recommended but not essential: Prior experience with a scripting language, such as python, MATLAB or R.

##### <b>Introduction to Cleaning & Transforming Data with OpenRefine</b>

a.	If you’re using a personal device follow the instructions [here](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html#openrefine) under ‘OpenRefine’.
b.	If you’re using a University of Auckland device, search for and install ‘Corretto OpenJDK’ in Software Center (Windows) or Self-Service (Mac). Then go [here](https://openrefine.org/download.html) and download the latest version of ‘Windows (without Java)’ under ‘Other platforms and versions’.

##### <b>Introduction to R and RStudio</b>

a.	If you’re using a personal device follow the instructions [here](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/setup-r-workshop.html#r-and-rstudio) for your operating system.
b.	If you’re using a University of Auckland device, search for ‘r project’ in Software Center (Windows) or Self-Service (Mac) and install ‘R’, then search for and install ‘RStudio’.

##### <b>Introduction to the Command Line</b>

If you are using Windows, please install Git for Windows. See [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell) for instructions.

##### <b>Introduction to Using Julia for Machine Learning</b>

1. [Install Julia 1.9](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl/blob/dev/FIRST_STEPS.md). 
2. [Install workshop resources](https://github.com/ablaom/HelloJulia.jl/wiki/Preparing-for-your-ResBaz-2023-Julia-workshop). 

- **Highly recommended:** Attend 'Getting Started with the Julia Programming Language' before attending this workshop.
- Recommended: An understanding of basic linear algebra and statistics, such as that covered in first year university courses. 
- Recommended but not essential: Prior experience with a scripting language, such as python, MATLAB or R.

##### <b>Introduction to Web Mapping with Leaflet</b>
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

##### <b>Managing References with Zotero</b>

If you'd like to follow along you will need to:
1. Go to (https://www.zotero.org/user/register) and create a zotero account.
2. Go to (https://www.zotero.org/download/) and install both Zotero (a standalone app) and the appropriate Zotero Connector (an extension for your browser). OR on University of Auckland devices: Instead install Zotero through the Software Center (Windows) or Self Service (Mac).
3. Open Zotero and from the top menu bar select Edit > Preferences > Sync and fill in your zotero account details.
We recommend a two-screen setup for those wishing to follow along.

##### <b>Using The Command Line To Find, Replace, And Manipulate Data</b>

If you are using Windows, please install Git for Windows. See [here](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell) for instructions.
