  title: Introduction to the Command Line
  description: "The Unix shell is a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex
    tasks, such as making a series of changes to a large number of images or text
    files, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate
    repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful workflows.
    Use of the command line is often required to interact with High Performance Computing
    services such as those offered by NeSI, and it is used extensively in the the
    data manipulation workflows in some disciplines. This workshop will introduce
    you to this powerful tool so that you can apply it to your research work. The
    target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational experience,
    and the instructors prioritise creating a friendly environment to build confidence
    in research computing. Even those with some experience will benefit, as the goal
    is to create automated and reproducible workflows. For instance, after attending
    this workshop you will be able to navigate the filesystem, manipulate files, change
    the behaviour of commands with options and arguments, write scripts to perform
    actions on many files at once.\n\n "

  title: What is the Julia Programming Language and is it Right for Me?
  description: Julia is a relatively new but exciting, multi-purpose programming language,
    with increasing adoption among scientific researchers. Interaction with Julia
    closely resembles that of scripting languages, such as R, MATLAB and python, and
    a growing number of Julia libraries provide similar functionality for scientific
    computation. However, extending modifying, or creating new software in these older
    languages is complicated as all performance critical code must be written in a
    second, low-level language, like C or FORTRAN, which are more technically demanding,
    and are slower to test, debug, etc. Julia's careful and elegant design solves
    this two language problem. In this presentation and Q&A session, find out if Julia
    is a good match for your research project.

    on social media that hooks a viewer's attention to read your article. Like a 3-minute
    thesis is a verbal elevator pitch, a visual abstract is a pictorial summary understood
    in a 30-second glance. Designed with icons and keywords, they are simpler than
    a graphical abstract and quicker to make. Visual abstracts are a powerful thinking
    tool for yourself and a valuable communication tool to engage others. The first
    half of the session is an interactive exploration of visual abstracts to inspire
    your imagination. The second half is a guided workshop where together we build
    your creative confidence by making a visual abstract. "

  title: 'Getting data from the web: An introduction to webscraping and APIs'
  description: 'There are all kinds of useful sources of research data on the web,
    such as tables on webpages, or records available only via APIs (Application Programming
    Interfaces). Extracting or assembling this data into a useable form by hand is
    often prohibitively time consuming or difficult. However, if you know how to scrape
    data or use an API it opens up all sorts of interesting data sources for you to
    include in your research. In this practical, follow-along workshop, we will start
    by introducing some important considerations when working with data from the web
    (ethics, terms of use, copyright). We’ll then explore how data can be scraped
    from webpages, retrieved from APIs, and processed into a tabular form ready for
    analysis. Participants are expected to have a novice-level understanding of Python. '

  title: How to present data & results on a self-updating website, using GitHub Actions
  description: 'This workshop describes a workflow for creating a self-updating website,
    hosted on GitHub Pages and powered by GitHub Actions, both of which are free services
    (with some limitations). These kinds of websites allow you to build up a dataset
    over time and display that data as a dynamic ‘dashboard’ which automatically updates
    with new data. Participants will benefit from a basic understanding of web scraping,
    either by attending "Getting data from the web", or through prior knowledge. This
    2 hour taster session will introduce and link important concepts, offer a chance
    to ask questions, and provide participants with useful resources, but it will
    not be a hands-on session where participants can follow along. '

  title: Hands-on introduction to leveraging containers in research code
  description: Have you ever found yourself with a potpourri of Python versions lingering
    in your laptop, conflicting between one another or drowning you in dependency
    hell? Have you ever found yourself trying to use custom software environments
    from a colleague or the internet, only to find it more difficult to install, than
    it is to run? Or, have to try to share your code with lab mates, and they just
    cannot get it to work without you? If you ever find yourself running into reproducibility
    issues in those scenarios, or even with your own software some years later, this
    session is for you.This hand-ons workshop will introduce you to containers, using
    Docker, to help you create, maintain, share and consume code for your research
    in a manner that promotes reproducibility and provenance. And hopefully alleviate
    some of those pain points with research software.A minimum knowledge of the command
    line, i.e. launching commands, listing and editing files or changing directories
    is required.

  title: Introduction to version control with Git
  description: Are you working with code? Do you wish there was a neater way to keep
    an old copy of your code around, in case you still needed them? Do you need to
    collaborate with your colleagues? This workshop is for you! We will introduce
    Git, a version control system, for tracking changes on your local machine. We
    will also briefly touch on how to use GitHub as a remote repository. Git keeps
    track of changes to code and free us from the burden of keeping multiple files
    with increasingly long and complex filenames. Even though version control systems
    originated in the world of software development, they're just as useful when working
    with research projects. You can also connect to a remote repository like GitHub,
    which allows you to keep a backup of your code and its history, sync across your
    devices, and have powerful features for collaborating with your colleagues. If
    you're planning to write any kind of code during your research, it's highly recommended
    you understand and use version control systems like Git and remote repositories
    like GitHub to improve the way you work and collaborate (and to make it more enjoyable).
    This is a beginner-friendly workshop - participants will benefit from having some
    basic experience with a command-line, but this isn't required.

  title: Joining the dots for modern data science workflows
  description: Modern research often makes use of programming and other data science
    tools, but it can be confusing trying to assemble all the pieces and understand
    how different tools are used together. This workshop uses the example of Python
    code to plot geospatial data with Geopandas and, along the way, introduces a variety
    of other tools that are commonly used to help with programming and digital workflows.
    We'll explain how and why to use a specialised code editor (Visual Studio Code),
    how to leverage version control with Git and use remote repositories on GitHub,
    how to use GitHub Actions, and how to incorporate generative AI tools like GitHub
    Copilot to facilitate writing and augmenting your code. This workshop aims to
    provide a map of these different tools to show how they can be used together to
    support reproducibility and openness in the research process. Some prior experience
    with programming will be beneficial, but this isn't required to attend, as this
    is not a hands-on code-along session.

  title: An introduction to cloud security for researchers
  description: Are you following security best practices? This is a tricky question
    and can vary widely depending on the technology you are using for your research.
    Additionally, security can be exceedingly difficult to implement effectively,
    while maintaining a balance between the level of security needed, and the effort
    required to implement and manage it. This talk will present security basics accompanied
    by some technical solutions researchers can implement to secure their cloud computing
    tools. We will introduce security controls and provide technical ways to implement
    these controls. For example, the use of network segmentation to secure systems,
    which can be accomplished in Nectar using private networks and security groups.
    Our primary cloud platform for demonstrations will be the Nectar Research Cloud
    - however, the techniques discussed will be transferable to other cloud platforms,
    such as AWS.
