  title: Introduction to R for Data Analysis
  description: Programming skills are becoming more and more important for researchers
    to effectively collect, analyse, and translate data into publication-ready insights
    and figures. But it can be difficult to 'take the plunge' and learn those first
    steps. This practical, follow-along workshop is aimed at those who are completely
    new to programming, and introduces the R programming language for data analysis.
    Participants will learn about the most important concepts for starting with R,
    including setting up a project in R, basic programming principles, reading in
    data, summarising and subsetting data, and creating basic plots. We aim to give
    participants a brief overview of what is possible with R and to inspire them to
    continue learning. Participants will be expected to follow along and will be provided
    with set up instructions in advance, which must be completed before the workshop.
    For a slightly more in-depth look at plotting in R, see "Data Storytelling with
    R and ggplot", and for statistical analyses with R, see "Hands-on Statistical
    Analysis with R".

  title: Introduction To The Command Line
  description: "The Unix shell is a powerful tool that allows users to perform complex\
    \ tasks, such as making a series of changes to a large number of images or text\
    \ files, often with just a few keystrokes or lines of code. It helps users automate\
    \ repetitive tasks and easily combine smaller tasks into larger, more powerful\
    \ workflows. Use of the command line is often required to interact with High Performance\
    \ Computing services such as those offered by NeSI, and it is used extensively\
    \ in the the data manipulation workflows in some disciplines. This workshop will\
    \ introduce you to this powerful tool so that you can apply it to your research\
    \ work. The target audience is learners who have little to no prior computational\
    \ experience, and the instructors prioritise creating a friendly environment to\
    \ build confidence in research computing. Even those with some experience will\
    \ benefit, as the goal is to create automated and reproducible workflows. For\
    \ instance, after attending this workshop you will be able to navigate the filesystem,\
    \ manipulate files, change the behaviour of commands with options and arguments,\
    \ write scripts to perform actions on many files at once.\n\n "

  title: Visual Abstracts Create An Attention Hook To Your Published Article
  description: Visual abstracts are a 'movie poster' of a journal article displayed
    on social media that hooks a viewer's attention to read your article. Like a 3-minute
    thesis is a verbal elevator pitch, a visual abstract is a pictorial summary understood
    in a 30-second glance. Designed with icons and keywords, they are simpler than
    a graphical abstract and quicker to make. Visual abstracts are a powerful thinking
    tool for yourself and a valuable communication tool to engage others. The first
    third of the session is an interactive exploration of visual abstracts to inspire
    your imagination. The middle third is an introductory level guided workshop to
    create a basic VA. The last third is an intermediate level workshop where we further
    explore tools, tips and icon libraries in more depth.

  title: An Introduction to Cloud Security for Researchers
  description: Are you following security best practices? This is a tricky question
    and can vary widely depending on the technology you are using for your research.
    Additionally, security can be exceedingly difficult to implement effectively,
    while maintaining a balance between the level of security needed, and the effort
    required to implement and manage it. This talk will present security basics accompanied
    by some technical solutions researchers can implement to secure their cloud computing
    tools. We will introduce security controls and provide technical ways to implement
    these controls. For example, the use of network segmentation to secure systems,
    which can be accomplished in Nectar using private networks and security groups.
    Our primary cloud platform for demonstrations will be the Nectar Research Cloud
    - however, the techniques discussed will be transferable to other cloud platforms,
    such as AWS.

  description: Are you working with code? Do you wish there was a neater way to keep
    an old copy of your code around, in case you still needed them? Do you need to
    collaborate with your colleagues? This workshop is for you! We will introduce
    Git, a version control system, for tracking changes on your local machine. We
    will also briefly touch on how to use GitHub as a remote repository. Git keeps
    track of changes to code and free us from the burden of keeping multiple files
    with increasingly long and complex filenames. Even though version control systems
    originated in the world of software development, they're just as useful when working
    with research projects. You can also connect to a remote repository like GitHub,
    which allows you to keep a backup of your code and its history, sync across your
    devices, and have powerful features for collaborating with your colleagues. If
    you're planning to write any kind of code during your research, it's highly recommended
    you understand and use version control systems like Git and remote repositories
    like GitHub to improve the way you work and collaborate (and to make it more enjoyable).
    This is a beginner-friendly workshop - participants will benefit from having some
    basic experience with a command-line, but this isn't required.

    \ data manually is time consuming. Webscraping allows you to harvest data via\
    \ a programming language across multiple pages fast, and convert it into a useable\
    \ form for analyses. This 1 hour workshop provides a basic introduction to scraping\
    \ tabular data from websites using the R programming language, and is aimed at\
    \ beginner programmers with a small amount of experience using R, or those new\
    \ to programming who\u2019d like to understand what is possible with scraping.\
    \ We\u2019ll look at two examples: scraping a table from a Wikipedia page, and\
    \ scraping a list of popular tv shows from the Internet Movie Database. We\u2019\
    ll then briefly look at how to automate the scraping of data using GitHub Actions,\
    \ to allow the construction of a dataset over time. Attendees will come away with\
    \ an understanding of how different tools and skills can be combined to get started\
    \ with webscraping in R. "

  title: Data Storytelling with R and ggplot
  description: "In today's research landscape, we are inundated with data. Effectively\
    \ translating this data into actionable insights is crucial for informed decision-making.\
    \ Understanding how data visualisations represent patterns and relationships can\
    \ help you avoid misinterpretation and tell compelling data-driven stories. This\
    \ workshop is aimed at those who want to create more bespoke plots for better\
    \ communication of results. Although the base plot packages are powerful, they\
    \ can become cumbersome when producing more complex plots. ggplot is based on\
    \ the Grammar of Graphics framework and provides a structured way to construct\
    \ basic and advanced plots. ggplot is a popular tool for data visualisation used\
    \ by R and Python users. Participants will learn how to use ggplot to create custom\
    \ plots that effectively communicate their data. They will gain hands-on experience\
    \ around a participant-selected question and come away with a custom plot that\
    \ answers that question. Participants should have a basic understanding of R,\
    \ including the ability to run code and load data. Familiarity with selecting,\
    \ filtering, and wrangling data is also recommended (and these topics are covered\
    \ in \u2018Introduction to R\u2019). "

  title: Unlocking the potential of the Stats NZ Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI)
    for research
  description: 'The Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI) is a large research database
    holding de-identified microdata about people and households in New Zealand. The
    breadth of topics covered and the length of its timeseries make it a world-leading
    research database. Researchers use the IDI to study health, education, social
    services, justice, communities, population, income, housing, and the interactions
    between them. However, the very things that make the IDI a powerful tool for research
    can also make it a difficult environment for new researchers to begin working
    with. This workshop will introduce the IDI, explain how researchers are using
    it, and provide guidance to help new researchers get started. This workshop is
    aimed at anyone who is interested in hearing more about the IDI and how they might
    use it for research. Attendees will gain a better understanding of the sort of
    research possible with the IDI, how the data is accessed and protected, and useful
    tips and guidance from an experienced IDI user.
