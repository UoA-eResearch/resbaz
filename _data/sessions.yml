    tasks that you can find no satisfactory single tool to perform. Along the way,
    you will learn how to choose appropriate commands for your tasks and develop an
    understanding of how the command line can help you to save time.\nBash is the
    default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that
    provide Unix-like tools for Windows.\nThis session will use the command-line bash
    shell  to introduce you to the basics, as far as time permits, of how to:\n* navigate
    the file-system\n* read, write, and modify files\n* parse data from and to files\n
    * create custom re-usable commands in the form of aliases, shell functions and

  title: What is the Julia Programming Language and is it Right for Me?
  description: "Julia is a relatively new but exciting, multi-purpose programming
    language, with increasing adoption among scientific researchers. Interaction with
    Julia closely resembles that of scripting languages, such as R, MATLAB and python,
    and a growing number of Julia libraries provide similar functionality for scientific
    computation. However, extending modifying, or creating new software in these older
    languages is complicated as all performance critical code must be written in a
    second, low-level language, like C or FORTRAN, which are more technically demanding,
    and are slower to test, debug, etc. Julia's careful and elegant design solves
    this two language problem. In this presentation and Q&A session, find out if Julia
    is a good match for your research project. "

  title: Keeping Your Spreadsheets Tidy
  description: Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We
    often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with
    it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use
    tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like
    R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers can make sense
    of it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want
    to start too! Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research
    workflow and some have estimated that this data preparation may take 4x as long
    as the 'analysis' itself. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in
    the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent, but the foundation
    is to start with a machine readable datasheet. In this workshop we will cover
    the basics of good data hygiene and the core principles of the tidy data framework
    which ensures that your data are machine readable and ready for manipulation/analysis.
    We encourage you to bring along a device that has access to some kind of spreadsheet
    software (e.g. GoogleSheets, Excel, etc.), so you can spot the problems and work
    towards putting tidy data into practice.

In distributed-memory parallelism an application achieves parallelism by running multiple instances of itself across multiple nodes to solve the problem. Each instance is allocated its own chunk of virtual memory and communicates to other instances via a message passing interface such as MPI. Distributed memory type jobs have many advantages, among which are more cores to tackle the problem and a far greater amount of memory. The workshop explains details of MPI environment, types of operations MPI employs and considerations given to various implementation models. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/parallel-programming-with-mpi-tickets-427700532807\">Book here</a>"

  title: How to Plan Your Research for Real World Impact
  description: Economic, societal and environmental impact, or the 'non-academic'
    impact of research, is becoming an increasingly important part of the research
    ecosystem. It is standard practice for researchers to be asked by funders to describe
    the benefits of their research and how they might enable that benefit to be achieved.
    This session offers a high-level step-by-step guide on how to incorporate impact
    into your research planning.

  title: Visual Abstracts Create an Attention Hook to Your Published Article
  description: Visual abstracts are a 'movie poster' of a journal article displayed
    on social media that hooks a viewer's attention to read your article. Like a 3-minute
    thesis is a verbal elevator pitch, a visual abstract is a pictorial summary understood
    in a 30-second glance. Designed with icons and keywords, they are simpler than
    a graphical abstract and quicker to make. Visual abstracts are a powerful thinking
    tool for yourself and a valuable communication tool to engage others. The first
    half of the session is an interactive exploration of visual abstracts to inspire
    your imagination. The second half is a guided workshop where together we build
    your creative confidence by making a visual abstract. Please also see this collection
    of <a

#   description: "Research data has become a primary target for cyberattacks. Recent reports found that attacks on educational institutions are growing faster than any other sector. It's been clear how vulnerable — and desirable — university research data is to bad actors, emphasizing that having properly secured research will be critical for warding off current and future attacks.And cybersecurity threats to research universities won't stop as Universities will remain repositories of invaluable proprietary and personal data, often tied to corporations and government organizations, that spans medical, military, financial and emerging technologies, and more. A data risk assessment will be the primary step to overcome some of the most common roadblocks preventing universities from securing research data. This one-hour presentation provides guidelines to performing a data risk assessment. A data risk assessment helps researchers gain visibility into all the potential threat vectors that can lead to security or privacy violations, and the awareness of which would help safeguard valuable research. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-security-addressing-risks-in-postgraduate-research-tickets-438725538897\">Book here</a>"

    of data, and researchers across different disciplines and methods all draw from
    text in different ways. Knowing even just a few basic computational linguistic
    methods can increase your efficiency as a researcher and open new avenues for
    research using your data. This short, introductory workshop will demonstrate how
    to perform basic operations on text, such as counting the frequency of different
    word types, computing measures of lexical diversity, and performing more complex
    operations such as sentiment analysis. No prior knowledge of programming is assumed.

  title: Modern Data Stack in a Box with DuckDB and dbt
  description: Are you interested in expanding your data engineering skills? Do you
    have your eyes set on future industry jobs? Whereas dbt is currently well in demand,
    Duckdb is a newer tool that will be rising in significance in the coming years.  The
    idea of a modern data stack in a box is to make you productive using best data
    engineering practices minus the high cloud costs. DuckDB is an in-process SQL
    management system designed for analytics. It is combined with dbt which acts as
    the transformation layer for your data pipelines, letting you create robust systems
    for analytics and machine learning. Why use a single machine and not the cloud?
    As a starting point for data engineering pipelines, this allows you to have a
    self-contained system and create end-to-end pipelines that can be deployed with
    ease to other systems. You can also have the option to take your code and deploy
    it to other dbt adapters. This makes dbt a core part of the modern data stack.
    Come and learn more about both DuckDB and dbt in this workshop.
