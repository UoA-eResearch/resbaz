#   description: "The current 'climate' is full of buzz words, such as: AI (artificial intelligence); deep learning; cloud computing, and the 'Internet of Things'. As consumers, and even research specialists, this can all be overwhelming. At ESR we are endeavouring to provide our staff, clients, and hopefully the wider community, with some insight into the technologies behind this jargon. In this talk I will discuss our experiences with the Nvidia Jetson family of small embedded computing platforms. What started as an idea to address a very personal need has developed into an international, collaborative, cross-programme study to develop and deploy an innovative, disruptive, portable and affordable sequencing technology into the hands of the community to empower their health and well-being. Additionally, the affordable, easy to source components provide exciting opportunities for such endeavours as community outreach and education.

#   description: "Open science is a lot more than open access. Sci-hub is not the goal. Open science unfolds new demands for culture change in the academy; it builds a new pathway toward more generous and joyful research practices and outcomes. Science is too consequential to be colonized by the neoliberal marketplace. 
#   I will open up a conversation about an alternative open science economy, and about the shared cultural practices—past and future science norms—that can make all of our research collectively better, quicker, more rigorous, and a lot more fun. From the infinite game of science—which you get to be paid to play—to the fierce equality of future global research that puts everyone’s work on a planetary stage: open science has really just begun (and Sci-hub is still kinda cool).

#   description: "Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!<br /><br /> 
#   Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidy-data-and-an-introduction-to-open-refine-tickets-128809746419/\">Book here</a> "

#   description: "Are you working with big data? Do you need to pass your data through various software?  If you’ve ever been in this situation (as I have in a population genetics masters project), you would know it can become very difficult to maintain reproducibility and accuracy; wait, have I updated this output file? The more manual steps we do, the more human errors are inevitably introduced into our analysis, hampering accuracy and reproducibility.<br /><br />
#   Be lazy, the machine does it better.<br /><br />
#   Workflow languages automate your data analysis workflow . But this isn’t all, they ensure all your analysis logs are captured in an organised fashion, they explicitly outline the software (and exact software versions) used, the input and output files at each step. Lastly, when your data inevitably becomes big data, you can easily scale up from running your analysis on your laptop, to running your analysis on a high performance cluster (HPC) such as NeSi.<br /><br />
#   In this workshop, we will work through an introduction to Snakemake, a workflow language with its basis in the popular programming language, Python.

  title: "Tidy data: an introduction"
  description: "Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers can make sense of it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too! Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow and some have estimated that this data preparation may take 4x as long as the \"analysis\" itself. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent, but the foundation is to start with a machine readable datasheet. In this workshop we will cover the basics of good data hygiene and the core principles of the tidy data framework which ensures that your data are machine readable and ready for manipulation/analysis. We encourage you to bring along a device that has access to some kind of spreadsheet software (e.g. google sheets, excel, etc.), so you can spot the problems and work towards putting tidy data into practice.

The second hour will give you the confidence to create your own customisations and content will be driven by participant interest. <p> This session is for you if you're a LaTeX user and need to collaborate with others, want to keep an up-to-date electronic notebook, or want the freedom of creating a distraction-free environment to focus on your writing. <p> Participants should have attended an introduction to Bash. Some Python background would be helpful, but not required. A LaTeX project template will be provided. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/stop-paying-for-free-software-creating-a-latex-pipeline-for-collaboration-tickets-202689378387\">Book here</a> "

  title: "Find, replace and manipulate big datasets"
  description: "Do you want to get better acquainted with the command line and use the tools that you did not know were in your arsenal? This practical workshop will introduce you to regular expression and how to implement it using sed and grep to manipulate big (or small) datasets so that they become fit for purpose. Think of this as find and replace/subset, but with functionality and usability that you did not know was possible. The knowledge gained can be used with applications such as Notepad++ and R. This session is interactive and examples will include handling, preparing, manipulating and/or formatting DNA databases, but these tools are so versatile that it is applicable to other datasets. <p> This workshop follows on from bash/introduction to command line session, and attendees need to have working knowledge of the basic commands that will allow you to navigate in the terminal and read, create and write directories/files (for example: cd, mkdir, ls, cat, nano, etc…).

  title: "High performance computations with multithreading"
  description: "A C-based workshop on using multiple threads to improve performance of your code. In shared-memory parallelism applications achieve parallelism by executing more than one thread at a time across cores within one node. Each of the threads see and manipulate the same memory that the initial process allocated. The workshop explains how parallelism is achieved in HPC applications, what considerations are to be given to the code, what are the benefits and drawbacks of multithreading. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/high-performance-computations-with-multithreading-tickets-202732858437\">Book here</a> "

  title: "Parallel programming with MPI"
  description: "A C-based workshop targeting distributed programming in high performance environment. In distributed-memory parallelism an application achieves parallelism by running multiple instances of itself across multiple nodes to solve the problem. Each instance is allocated its own chunk of virtual memory and communicates to other instances via a message passing interface such as MPI. Distributed memory type jobs have many advantages, among which are more cores to tackle the problem and a far greater amount of memory. The workshop explains details of MPI environment, types of operations MPI employs and considerations given to various implementation models. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/parallel-programming-with-mpi-tickets-202741313727\">Book here</a> "
