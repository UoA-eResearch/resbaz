  title: "Key Story - Harnessing the disruptive nature of portable sequencing for community empowerment"
  description: "The current 'climate' is full of buzz words, such as: AI (artificial intelligence); deep learning; cloud computing, and the 'Internet of Things'. As consumers, and even research specialists, this can all be overwhelming. At ESR we are endeavouring to provide our staff, clients, and hopefully the wider community, with some insight into the technologies behind this jargon. In this talk I will discuss our experiences with the Nvidia Jetson family of small embedded computing platforms. What started as an idea to address a very personal need has developed into an international, collaborative, cross-programme study to develop and deploy an innovative, disruptive, portable and affordable sequencing technology into the hands of the community to empower their health and well-being. Additionally, the affordable, easy to source components provide exciting opportunities for such endeavours as community outreach and education.

  title: "Key story - Exploring the cultural horizons of open science: your research and your life"
  description: "Open science is a lot more than open access. Sci-hub is not the goal. Open science unfolds new demands for culture change in the academy; it builds a new pathway toward more generous and joyful research practices and outcomes. Science is too consequential to be colonized by the neoliberal marketplace. 
  I will open up a conversation about an alternative open science economy, and about the shared cultural practices—past and future science norms—that can make all of our research collectively better, quicker, more rigorous, and a lot more fun. From the infinite game of science—which you get to be paid to play—to the fierce equality of future global research that puts everyone’s work on a planetary stage: open science has really just begun (and Sci-hub is still kinda cool).

  title: "Tidy data and introduction to OpenRefine"
  description: "Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers need it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too!<br /><br /> 
  Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another. This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/tidy-data-and-an-introduction-to-open-refine-tickets-128809746419/\">Book here</a> "

  title: "Workflow languages – your foundation for accuracy and reproducibility in data analysis"
  description: "Are you working with big data? Do you need to pass your data through various software?  If you’ve ever been in this situation (as I have in a population genetics masters project), you would know it can become very difficult to maintain reproducibility and accuracy; wait, have I updated this output file? The more manual steps we do, the more human errors are inevitably introduced into our analysis, hampering accuracy and reproducibility.<br /><br />
  Be lazy, the machine does it better.<br /><br />
  Workflow languages automate your data analysis workflow . But this isn’t all, they ensure all your analysis logs are captured in an organised fashion, they explicitly outline the software (and exact software versions) used, the input and output files at each step. Lastly, when your data inevitably becomes big data, you can easily scale up from running your analysis on your laptop, to running your analysis on a high performance cluster (HPC) such as NeSi.<br /><br />
  In this workshop, we will work through an introduction to Snakemake, a workflow language with its basis in the popular programming language, Python. This Workshop is intended for anyone who has several steps in their data analysis workflow, particularly when many different software are involved. <a href=\"https://vuw.libcal.com/event/5293465/\">Book here</a> "

  title: "Social Media for Research Networking and Engagement "
  description: "What does social media do for research impact and networking that more traditional forms of communication don't?<br /><br />
  This session will explore how to make the most of social media in a research context, including information on: getting information, providing information, networking with other academics, engaging with communities outside of academia, and finding your tribe. It will also address how you can manage the distinction between personal and professional on social media, and how to mitigate the dangers of using it. <a href=\"https://vuw.libcal.com/event/5293510/\">Zoom link</a> "
