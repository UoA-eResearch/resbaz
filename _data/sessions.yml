  description: "The Unix shell is a powerful command-line interface and scripting language which can automate repetitive tasks. The Unix philosophy is that each tool (command) should perform just one task, and perform it well. Learning the command-line is learning how to exploit these tools and compose them to perform tasks that you can find no satisfactory single tool to perform. Along the way, you will learn how to choose appropriate commands for your tasks and develop an understanding of how the command line can help you to save time. Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows. This session will use the command-line bash shell  to introduce you to the basics, as far as time permits, of how to: navigate the file-system; read, write, and modify files; parse data from and to files; create custom re-usable commands in the form of aliases, shell functions and shell scripts; automate repetitive tasks.

  title: "What is the Julia Programming Language and is it Right for Me?"
  description: "Julia is a relatively new but exciting, multi-purpose programming language, with increasing adoption among scientific researchers. Interaction with Julia closely resembles that of scripting languages, such as R, MATLAB and python, and a growing number of Julia libraries provide similar functionality for scientific computation. However, extending modifying, or creating new software in these older languages is complicated as all performance critical code must be written in a second, low-level language, like C or FORTRAN, which are more technically demanding, and are slower to test, debug, etc. Julia's careful and elegant design solves this two language problem. In this presentation and Q&A session, find out if Julia is a good match for your research project. Some previous exposure to a programming or scripting language would be useful but not required.

  title: "Tidy Data: An Introduction"
  description: "Good data organisation is the foundation of any research project. We often organise data in spreadsheets in ways that we as humans want to work with it, but computers require data be organised in particular ways. In order to use tools that make computation more efficient such as programming languages like R or Python, we need to structure our data the way that computers can make sense of it. Since this is where most research projects start, this is where we want to start too! Preparing data for analysis is an important part of the research workflow and some have estimated that this data preparation may take 4x as long as the 'analysis' itself. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identifed and corrected or formatting made consistent, but the foundation is to start with a machine readable datasheet. In this workshop we will cover the basics of good data hygiene and the core principles of the tidy data framework which ensures that your data are machine readable and ready for manipulation/analysis. We encourage you to bring along a device that has access to some kind of spreadsheet software (e.g. google sheets, excel, etc.), so you can spot the problems and work towards putting tidy data into practice.  <a href=\"\">Book here</a>"

#   description: "A C-based workshop on using multiple threads to improve performance of your code. In shared-memory parallelism applications achieve parallelism by executing more than one thread at a time across cores within one node. Each of the threads see and manipulate the same memory that the initial process allocated. The workshop explains how parallelism is achieved in HPC applications, what considerations are to be given to the code, what are the benefits and drawbacks of multithreading. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/high-performance-computations-with-multithreading-tickets-427699850767\">Book here</a>"

#   description: "A C-based workshop targeting distributed programming in high performance environment. In distributed-memory parallelism an application achieves parallelism by running multiple instances of itself across multiple nodes to solve the problem. Each instance is allocated its own chunk of virtual memory and communicates to other instances via a message passing interface such as MPI. Distributed memory type jobs have many advantages, among which are more cores to tackle the problem and a far greater amount of memory. The workshop explains details of MPI environment, types of operations MPI employs and considerations given to various implementation models. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/parallel-programming-with-mpi-tickets-427700532807\">Book here</a>"

  title: "Visual Abstracts Create an Attention Hook to Your Published Article"
  description: "Visual abstracts are a 'movie poster' of a journal article displayed on social media that hooks a viewer's attention to read your article. Like a 3-minute thesis is a verbal elevator pitch, a visual abstract is a pictorial summary understood in a 30-second glance. Designed with icons and keywords, they are simpler than a graphical abstract and quicker to make. Visual abstracts are a powerful thinking tool for yourself and a valuable communication tool to engage others. The first half of the session is an interactive exploration of visual abstracts to inspire your imagination. The second half is a guided workshop where together we build your creative confidence by making a visual abstract. Please also see this collection of <a href=\"https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:fbec7bab-b69d-3670-90e8-436ae9954bba\">self-paced multimedia resources</a> related to visual abstracts. <a href=\"\">Book here</a>"

#   description: "Research data has become a primary target for cyberattacks. Recent reports found that attacks on educational institutions are growing faster than any other sector. It's been clear how vulnerable — and desirable — university research data is to bad actors, emphasizing that having properly secured research will be critical for warding off current and future attacks.And cybersecurity threats to research universities won't stop as Universities will remain repositories of invaluable proprietary and personal data, often tied to corporations and government organizations, that spans medical, military, financial and emerging technologies, and more. A data risk assessment will be the primary step to overcome some of the most common roadblocks preventing universities from securing research data. This one-hour presentation provides guidelines to performing a data risk assessment. A data risk assessment helps researchers gain visibility into all the potential threat vectors that can lead to security or privacy violations, and the awareness of which would help safeguard valuable research. <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-security-addressing-risks-in-postgraduate-research-tickets-438725538897\">Book here</a>"

We will be using R as an example but Python, R, Julia, and Observable JavaScript are the primary languages Quarto support. R-specific experience is not required. Further instructions will be provided closer to the session. Before the session please install: - Quarto (https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/); R (https://www.r-project.org/); Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git); log in to GitHub (or sign up for a free account) (https://github.com/); install VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and in the extensions tab of VS Code install the R, Quarto, and Git extensions.  <a href=\"\">Book here</a>"
