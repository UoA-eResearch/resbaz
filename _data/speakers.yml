    underlie change in ecosystems overtime and space. His main research focus is around
    biotic interactions and how ecosystems respond to environmental and climate change.
    Much of his previous research focused on long-term ecological trajectories and
    palaeoecology. Currently, Quinn is exploring contemporary ecosystem change through
    process-based models.
