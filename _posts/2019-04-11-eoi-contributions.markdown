Last year's event at Auckland was a great success and we're looking to make this year's event, 10-12 July, even better. We are currently seeking expressions of interest from across the University. If you would like to help organise or contribute to the event this year, or suggest any ideas about what you would like to see in the programme, please let us know by filling in this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdgWaF3rHVWg6zJyd6o1JIuixRSoWtKs5SAIwYnf_EAUNFFGQ/viewform).

Thanks!
