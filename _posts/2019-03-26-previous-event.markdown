ResBaz Auckland 2018 was such a success. This year we hope to take all the best bits, add new speakers and sessions, and offer the same great experience - learning, mingling and eating!

While we work on the 2019 programme please check the sessions from our [2018 Auckland Research Bazaar](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/auckland/) website.
